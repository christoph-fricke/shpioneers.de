# Adding Sponsor
just add the sponsor to both relevant json files 

if you dont add it to both files it will not show up in the respective language

finance sponsors go in the file called finance and so on

adding involves copying an already existing elemt of the json array and pasting it at the index you desire
objects are the text that is inside {} these brackets. they are seperated by , and the entire file is enclosed by []
