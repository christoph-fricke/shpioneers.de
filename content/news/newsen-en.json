After the state championship we had the racetrack as our guest. We haven\u00b4t got a new car, but we thought it would be useful to take a close look at the old models anyway. Therefor we used the light barrier system Hanno built, which already was called into action in the test runs. With it we were able to exactly document the race to gain some further insight. In the next weeks we are going to analyse our results to use them for the construction of our new car."},{"title":"We are state champion!","image":"assets\/img\/news\/awarding.jpg","date":"19.02.2017","subtitle":"","preview":"After a lot of hard work we reached our first milestone.","text":"This weekend the Schleswig-Holstein Formula one in schools championship, which we prepared over the last few months, took place. We put up our stall on friday and still had plenty of time left to go over our presentation again. <br> We left early for Elmshorn on saturday morning. After the official opening, we were one of the first teams to present our stall. Before lunch we also had our oral presentation, followed by our race. Unfortunately we had a 0.1 seconds penalty due to some flaws in our construction. We still reached the fourth place with a resulting time of 1.232s. So we were quite content with our results when we went into lunchbreak. In the knock-out-race we reached second place.<br>In the end we won the Nordmetall-Cup in Schleswig-Holstein and were awarded the special awards for construction, portfolio and stall."}]
