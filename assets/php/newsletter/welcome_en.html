<b>About us</b><br>
We are six senior student from a high school in Northern Germany(Gymnasium Kronshagen). This year our team the <i>"<span style="color: #FF6600;">Pioneers</span>"</i> have qualified for the World Finals.<br>
Over the next months we want to do our best to present our results in line with our motto:<br>
<span style="color: #FF6600;">creating new ways</span><br><br>
As you might have guessed, we want to leave the beaten track that is by beeing Pioneers and as innovative as possible. <br><br>
<b>What we do for Formula 1 in Schools</b><br>
The competition demands a diverse range of tasks. The main objective is to construct and design a miniature Formula 1 racing car that will race against cars created by other teams. In order to do this by using CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing). In addition we will need to find sponsors who are willing to help us to build the car. Each of our team members has a specific area of expertise, which you can read about on our <a href="http://shpioneers.de">website</a>.<br><br>
